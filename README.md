# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. We've used machine learning models to make these predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/diabetes-dataset). We would like to extend our gratitude to the dataset creator, Kandi Jagadish, for making this dataset available.

You can also find the dataset file in this repository [here](https://github.com/mpurvesh007/diabetic_prediction/blob/main/diabetes2.csv). It contains information on pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the diabetes outcome (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Jupyter Notebook

The code for this project is available in the Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/mpurvesh007/diabetic_prediction/blob/main/Diabetes_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb).

## Models Used

We have implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Model Files

You can download the trained Logistic Regression model from [here](https://github.com/mpurvesh007/diabetic_prediction/blob/main/logistic_regression_model.pkl).
